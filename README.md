## Welcome to the nmgn stack

The nmgn stack is intended to provide a simple and fun starting point for cloud native fullstack javascript applications offering everything from authentication to deployment.   
NMGN is a set of Open Source components that together, provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web applications; starting from the top (code running in the browser) to the bottom (database). The stack is made up of:

- **N**estJS : TypeScript based Back-end framework running on top of Node.js
- **M**ongoDB : Document database â€“ used by your back-end application to store its data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents
- **G**raphQL : GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data
- **N**ext.js : React framework implementing server-side rendering and many optimizations to get running very quickly
